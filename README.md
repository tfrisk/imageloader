# Image Loader

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tfrisk/imageloader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tfrisk/imageloader)

Load all images from given url.

## Usage

```
usage: imageloader.py [-h] -u URL [-D DIR] [-d]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url URL  URL to read
  -D DIR, --dir DIR  Write images to specific directory
  -d, --debug        Display debug messages
```

Python version 2.7 or later is required (works with python 3).

Option `-D DIR` is optional, the default location is `./saved-images`.

## Running

Just execute the script with `-u URL` parameter, for example

```
$ python ./imageloader.py -u http://www.google.com
```

This will read the specified URL (`http://www.google.com` in this case)
and save every image it can scrape from the html and download to
directory `saved-images`. Download directory contains a list of downloaded
files (`filelist.txt`).

Running the test suite is done by running the test file

```
$ python ./test_imageloader.py
```

Code is tested in Arch Linux with python 2.7, python 3.6 and pypy 5.6.
Code is checked with pylint 2.0.0 (Python 3).

Required libraries are `beautifulsoup4`, `requests` and `lxml`.

## Limitations

Images with <picture> element containers are not supported as they
are much harder to assemble together than traditional <img> elements.

Embedded base64 encoded images are not supported.

Excepts given url is reachable with status code 200. Redirected urls
are not tested and may not work.

Images are saved with their original names which could be messy.

Image directory structure is not preserved, all images are saved in one
directory flat.

Generated download log ('filelist.txt') is not sorted.

Network throttling in url verification is very rudimentary (random sleep
between 50-500 ms) and does not work properly with python 2. Image
download does not have throttling at all.
